"The spinal level mediates connection of pathway from efferent information sent from brain to contraction of muscle. Also is able to respond to reflexes that are not sent to brain. Fine tuning may occur.",

the \\\"fine tuning\\\" or muscle contractions",
"the spinal cord controls what our other muscles in our body are doing. takes in information form the surrounding and accommodates for balance, reflexes.",
